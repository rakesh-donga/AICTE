Steganography is a technique that enables the concealment of data within digital media, such as images, in a way that prevents detection by unauthorized users
Key Concepts:
Image Selection: The process begins with selecting a suitable image for embedding the secret data. Ideally, the image should have a high level of complexity and a large size to accommodate more data without noticeable alterations.

Data Encoding: The secret data, which can be text, binary files, or other forms of information, is encoded using various algorithms. Common techniques include:

Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion: Modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values to embed the data, which results in minimal visual changes.
Transform Domain Techniques: Utilizing frequency domain transformations (like Discrete Cosine Transform or Discrete Wavelet Transform) to embed data in a way that is less perceptible to the human eye.
Encryption: To enhance security, the data can be encrypted before embedding. This ensures that even if the steganographic method is discovered, the information remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.

Embedding Process: The encoded and possibly encrypted data is then embedded into the selected image using the chosen steganographic technique. The process must be carefully executed to avoid introducing artifacts that could reveal the presence of hidden data.

Extraction: The recipient, who possesses the necessary key (if encryption is used), can extract the hidden data from the image using a corresponding extraction algorithm. This process involves reversing the embedding steps to retrieve the original information.

Robustness and Capacity: The effectiveness of a steganographic method is often measured by its robustness (resistance to detection and modification) and capacity (amount of data that can be hidden). Advanced techniques aim to maximize both aspects, ensuring that the hidden data remains secure even under various attacks.

Applications: Secure data hiding in images has numerous applications, including:

Secure Communication: Protecting sensitive information in military, governmental, or corporate communications.
Digital Watermarking: Embedding copyright information or ownership details within images.
Data Integrity Verification: Ensuring that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.
